  	<h1>Protective Shield Monologue</h1>
  	<p> I keep things in.  Things.  Emotions.  My emotions…I know that that’s probably not a good thing.  Life has made me that way I guess. <strong>I have a tendency to show no emotion when I am feeling emotion.</strong>

    I just have a hard time opening up to someone.  I get closed off. I feel that by being emotional in front of someone, kind of makes me very vulnerable and weak and I have a hard time with that. You know, being in that state of vulnerability, it’s not a place where I like to be because I feel like I’m not in control.  When I’m not in control, I get anxiety.</p>
    <p>Whenever I truly loved anybody and opened myself up to them, they have always <em>stabbed me in the back.</em>  I have a hard time with that; trusting people.  It can be anyone…friends, family, boyfriend.  I’m not sure if I truly trust anyone in my life.  It’s sort of a <a href="https://precious-portfolio.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">protective shield</a> I’ve put up and it only gets stronger with time.

    I do desire to be more vulnerable but at the same time I desire to stay protected.  I feel torn.  Every time I do take a risk, I get hurt.  Not sure if I should keep taking those risks.</p>

Only a true best friend can protect you from your immortal enemies. ...
One had to build shelters. ...
We must protect and share the world.</blockquote>
